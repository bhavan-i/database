Two ways of creating a java project---------1.integrated development environment(ide)
                                                example:eclipse
                                            2. note pad,.........we write in note pad and 
						command prompt to    complie and run
for compiling javac filename.java
to run java filename

*compiling in ide is done automatically by eclipse
*for command prompt it is similar to complie and running as in python
CLASS:
The predefined templet like gods creation of a thing or animal
OBJECT:
all those present in a class is a object
What is Inside a class?
1. Methods-----------any operation that can be done by a class(like car can move,sound from class etc)
2. Variables----------static information given by a class(like car colour, make,model number)
					Class
					  |
					Methods(variables,while,main)
					  |
				     statements
                            (group of statments form a method)

* A Java program has one class or multiple classes
*********After every statement, we have semicolon;
*******classes has two types          1. Class header(-----1------,-----2-----,------3------)
				      2. Class body
1 in class header tell to whom it is visible like public or private(access specifier)
2 in class header  tell key word and 
3 gives the class name(prgrm nam)
******Any thing written in between {
					} is called class body
WHAT IS THERE IN CLASS BODY??
we have methods------1'method header  (public static void main (string[] args)
		      2. method body
PUBLIC:
STATIC:to load the class with out creating object
VOID :does not return anything
to return a particular data type put int/string/float
MAIN:start of a program
The data obtained from method is being stored in ARGS
